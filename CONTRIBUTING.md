## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/your-username/ChronoRetrace/issues). Before opening a new issue, please perform a search to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has, and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. Fill out the required template, the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please open an issue to discuss it. This allows us to coordinate our efforts and prevent duplication of work.

### Pull Requests

We use the "Fork & Pull" model for contributions. Hereâ€™s a quick guide:

1.  **Fork the repository** to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Clone the project** to your machine: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/ChronoRetrace.git`
3.  **Create a new branch** for your changes: `git checkout -b my-feature-branch`
4.  **Make your changes**. Ensure your code adheres to the project's coding standards.
    - For the backend, we use `ruff` for linting.
    - For the frontend, we use `eslint`.
5.  **Commit your changes**: `git commit -m "feat: A brief description of the feature"`
6.  **Push to your branch**: `git push origin my-feature-branch`
7.  **Open a Pull Request** from your fork to the main ChronoRetrace repository. Provide a clear description of the changes and link any relevant issues.
